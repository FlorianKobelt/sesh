Fun little piece of code which tells you how you should exercise at the gym!

Personal project by Florian Kobelt aimed to be used when going to the gym with friends.
Enter an area of your body which you want to work out.
The output will give you a list of exercises and how many sets you should do!


Still WIP.
I plan to implement some fun and interesting twists to spice up the gym session. For example, imagining having to do 10 sets!!! Those poor poor arms...
I also want to implement a 'Random' setting which randomizes your gym activities!
